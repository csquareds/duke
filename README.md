consists of code for graphing and analyzing measure of hydrophobicity of nanoparticles

#concentration volume.py for C1V1 = C2V2

#dls.py for DLS graph, two axes (legend is a little weird still)

#quick.py writes lines to load and graph data quicker

#surface area.py for calculating surface area based on particles per mL, NP diameter, and stock and final concentrations

#zeta.py for zeta potential graph
